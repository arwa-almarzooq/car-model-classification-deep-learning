Deep learning computer vision project that classifies car models from images using the Stanford Cars Dataset.
# Car Model Classification 🚗🧠

This project is a deep learning computer vision system that identifies the car model directly from an image.

The model is trained on the Stanford Cars Dataset, which contains images of cars organized by model and class.

## Dataset
- Stanford Cars Dataset
- Images organized by car model and class
- Train / Test split

## Approach
- Image classification using deep learning
- Dataset loading and preprocessing
- Training and evaluation using PyTorch

## Features
- Recognizes car models from raw images
- Handles large multi-class classification
- Trained on real-world car images

## Tools
- Python
- PyTorch
- Torchvision
- KaggleHub
- Google Colab

## Notes
This project demonstrates strong hands-on experience in computer vision, dataset handling, and deep learning model training.
